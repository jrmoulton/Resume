\cvsection{Projects}
\cvproject{Interpreter and Compiler from Scratch}
\begin{itemize}
    \item An interpreter and a compiler for a dynamic programmign language with a python/rust like
        syntax that lexes tokens from an input, parses the token stream using a recursive descent
		either interprets or compiles and executes the final AST (including
        function objects) with high quality error handling and messages to the end user in a REPL.
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\smallskip
\cvproject{Open Source Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{esp-hal}: Work on embedded-hal SPI implementation
    \item \textbf{slint-ui}: Treesitter parser and various additions
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\smallskip
\cvproject{DACx0501 Library}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A Rust library supporting the Texas Instruments x0501 family of DACs using the
        rust embedded-hal traits
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\smallskip
\cvproject{Sodoku Solver}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A Sodoku Solver that generates a valid (although not
		necessarily solvable) Sodoku puzzle and uses a backtracing algorithm to
		solve it. 
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\cvproject{BFS Maze Solver}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A maze solver that uses a Breadth First Search to find the shortest
        path from the start to the finish of a puzzle created as an array of
        arrays filled with ones and zeros. Problem from Google Foo Bar
        Challenge.
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\cvproject{Aggietime Clock API}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A Rocket web app that acts as a man in the middle to
		re-expose the USU Aggietime API in an accessible way. This app parses
		tokens from the HTML responses of Aggietime and then forwards along a
		proper request with the credentials from the end user.
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\cvproject{Dense Neural Network from Scratch}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A dense, fully connected neural network made to recognize hanwritten
		digits from the MNIST dataset written from scratch in numpy.
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\cvproject{Static Website Generator}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Personal website and blog with content being written in markdown and then generated using a
		custom static site generator with awesome code syntax highlighting and theming.
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\cvproject{Multithreaded Mandelbrot Generator}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A Mandelbrot image generator written in rust that splits the 
		image's rows to be processed by multiple threads. The final output format 
		is a bpm where the image header information is written as a stream of raw 
		bytes followed by the image data.
\end{itemize}
