\cvsection{Projects}
\cvproject{Multithreaded Mandelbrot Generator}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A Mandelbrot image generator written in rust that splits the 
		image's rows to be processed by multiple threads. The final output format 
		is a bpm where the image header information is written as a stream of raw 
		bytes followed by the image data.
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\smallskip
\cvproject{Aggietime Clock API}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A Rocket web app written in rust that acts as a man in the middle to
		re-expose the USU Aggietime API in an accessible way. This app parses
		tokens from the HTML responses of Aggietime and then forwards along a
		proper request with the credentials from the end user.
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\smallskip
\cvproject{Sodoku Solver}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A Sodoku Solver written in C++ that generates a valid (although not
		necessarily solvable) Sodoku puzzle and uses a backtracing algorithm to
		solve it. 
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\smallskip
\cvproject{BFS Maze Solver}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A maze solver written in C++ that uses a Breadth First Search to find 
		the shortest path from the start to the finish of a puzzle created as an 
		array of arrays filled with ones and zeros. Problem from Google Foo Bar
		Challenge.
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\smallskip
\cvproject{Sorting Algorithm Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Implementations and analysis of several sorting algorithms. The time
		to run each algorithm was saved to csv files and analysis was done with
		numpy in Jupyter notebooks.
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\smallskip
\cvproject{Dense Neural Network from Scratch}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A dense, fully connected neural network made to recognize hanwritten
		digits from the MNIST dataset written from scratch in numpy.
\end{itemize}
